# Under One Roof

## Project Summary:

This is a full stack web application that allows for a household to create a unique account, add roommates as users with important contact information, create a chore list and fairly delegate them out, add expenses and dynamically update a household budget, and add events for important dates and reminders. Each user has their own homepage that aggregates the information pertinent to them. The stack used is Sequelize, Express, React, and Node.
